      <div id="intro">
        Pickling is the process of preserving or extending the lifespan of food
        by either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar. In
        East Asia, vinaigrette (vegetable oil and vinegar) is also used as a
        pickling medium.The pickling procedure typically affects the food's
        texture, taste and flavor. The resulting food is called a pickle, or, to
        prevent ambiguity, prefaced with pickled. Foods that are pickled include
        vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, dairy and eggs.
